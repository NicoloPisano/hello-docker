# Images

## Building images

A docker image is made of one or more layers. Each layer is built on top of the previous one and they're all immutable. This means you can't modify an existing layer, instead you create a new one made of changes from the previous layer. This is very similar to how `git`'s diff works.

In order to build an image, you will need a `Dockerfile`. Try the one for the web app image you've been using by `git clone`ing the `https://github.com/bitlogic/hello-docker/` public github repo.

In that project's root dir, do:

```
docker build -t test-image .
```

Aaaaaand that's it! üê≥

If you run it and inspect its contents, you'll notice it's the same as `bitlogic/hello-docker`'s, which mirrors the file system in that project.

Each instruction (`FROM`, `RUN`, etc.) in the `Dockerfile` generates a single, immutable layer.



## Understanding layers and leveraging the cache

Notice that if you run the same command again, it will take no time at all. This is because docker caches each layer and doesn't re-build them if the build context and layer creation command didn't change since the last build.

Now change the `FROM ubuntu:14.04` line to `FROM ubuntu:latest` so you try how it works with the latest `ubuntu` version and build it again

You'll see that all layers get rebuilt! This is because you changed the _base layer_; since all layers are just diffs from the previous one, by changing the base layer you invalidate the cache for all layers after it.

Now change the string message in line 5 and build again.

Faster, right? üòé

We now see that the base layer gets reused, but everything else gets re-done, including installing dependencies. In your everyday development workflow, you don't want to reinstall all dependencies just because you changed a single source file, you would only want that if you changed code files.

You may publish this image by using the command `docker push`, but you'll need an account in [`hub.docker.com`](https://hub.docker.com); you can do that later on your own. For now, let's [learn how to `docker-compose`](https://github.com/bitlogic/hello-docker/tree/master/3-docker-compose)
